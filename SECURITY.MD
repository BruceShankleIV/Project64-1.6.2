TLB Vulnerability from ancient 1.6 has been fixed, ASLR is implemented, the app is now DEP compatible, always uses hJobs, and all URL's are blocked.

If another vulnerability is found, report the details of it privately or publicly, though I doubt it will pose much risk to user safety anyways with
ASLR and hJobs. Below is why I think that, an explanation from AI.

### Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)

**What is ASLR?**
ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) is a security feature used by operating systems to protect against memory corruption vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, stack smashing, and return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks. It works by randomizing the memory address space of key components of a program at runtime. This includes:
- The base address of the program
- Libraries (e.g., shared objects or DLLs)
- Heap memory
- Stack memory

**How does ASLR improve program security?**
The primary goal of ASLR is to make it more difficult for attackers to predict the location of critical code or data in memory. By randomizing memory addresses, the following security benefits are achieved:
1. **Increased Unpredictability**: Exploits that rely on hardcoded memory addresses (e.g., jumping to shellcode or malicious payloads) become unreliable.
2. **Mitigation of Code Reuse Attacks**: Techniques like Return-Oriented Programming (ROP), which require knowledge of specific memory locations, are significantly harder to execute.
3. **Crash instead of Compromise**: An attacker relying on a predictable memory layout is more likely to cause the program to crash when attempting an exploit, rather than successfully compromising it.

### hJobs (Job Objects in Windows)

**What are hJobs?**
In Windows, a **job object** (often referred to as `hJob`, where `h` indicates a handle) is a kernel object that allows the management of a group of processes as a single unit. It is commonly used to enforce resource limits, manage process lifetimes, and apply security restrictions.

**How do hJobs improve program security?**
Job objects enhance security in several ways:
1. **Process Isolation and Containment**:
   - A job object can limit the resources (e.g., CPU, memory, I/O) available to processes within it, reducing the impact of malicious or runaway processes.
   - By setting restrictions on child processes, hJobs can prevent privilege escalation or code injection attacks.

2. **Security Policies**:
   - Job objects can enforce restrictions on the processes they manage, such as denying the ability to create new processes, load specific DLLs, or access certain system resources.

3. **Graceful Termination**:
   - All processes in a job can be terminated as a group, which is particularly useful in sandboxing scenarios or when dealing with untrusted or compromised processes.

4. **Mitigation of Sandbox Escapes**:
   - Applications that utilize sandboxing (e.g., browsers, containers) often use job objects to ensure that processes cannot break out of their restricted environments or negatively impact the host system.

### Combined Security Impact

Together, ASLR and hJobs provide complementary security mechanisms:
- **ASLR** focuses on defending against memory-based attacks by making key memory locations unpredictable.
- **hJobs** enforce process-level restrictions and resource controls, ensuring that even if a process is compromised, it operates within a tightly controlled environment.

By leveraging both, systems can achieve significantly enhanced protection against a wide range of security threats.
