These apps are bundled with the emulator to allow you to...

Patch baseROMs with Flips or Flips Auto Patcher to generate
ROMhacks.

Use HxD to hex edit ROMhack internal names or CRC's if this
benefits the experience on the emulator (development tool).

ppf-o-matic is for legacy .ppf patch format. Use for those.

Convert ROMs to Big Endian .z64 format with tool64 to apply
patches to them to play ROMhacks on the emulator.

Extract from .001 files with .002 and .003 and so on beside
it (in the same directory as it) using WinRAR. This is part
of a multi-volume archive. When you extract from .001 file,
it's merging the other .00 files with it and decompressing!
