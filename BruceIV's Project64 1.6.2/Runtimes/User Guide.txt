Limit FPS quick note - If you want to be able to always toggle Limit FPS, change your sound plugin! It's
not able to be toggled while using Jabo's DirectSound with most games from emulating Sync Game to Audio.
Also don't use Glide64 or Jabo's Legacy Direct3D for your video plugin as these seem to limit the speed.


TEXTURE PACK SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:

Glide64 - Put the .dat files in the Plugin\cache folder (fast) or put the
	  Rice format folder in Plugin\hires_texture (slow on first run).

GLideN64 - Put the .htc file in the cache folder and make sure it is named
	   with nothing before the internal name. For OoT it starts with 
	   "THE LEGEND OF ZELDA". Or put the Rice format folder in
	   Plugin\hires_texture (slow on first run).

IMPORTANT: If a texture pack doesn't seem to be loading with GLideN64, try
	   enabling or disabling Use file storage instead of memory cache.
	   ^ Found under the Texture enhancement tab. ON is applicable for
	   .hts texture packs, OFF is applicable for .htc texture packs.

Rice - Put the Rice format folder in Plugin\hires_texture. Uncheck Hide
       Advanced Options, then enable "Load hi-res textures if available"
       under the Texture Filters tab.

If a rice texture pack format folder does not work with a plugin, try the
use .dat format for Glide64 and .htc format for GLideN64 for good results
but remember to turn on Use file storage instead of memory cache for .hts
format for GLideN64. Remember dat/htc/hts files go into the cache folder!

Section#1 Accuracy and What This Emulator Is Good For
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Accuracy is a double-edged sword so I have tried to avoid making the program more accurate in some ways,
otherwise it can lead to emulating crashes which would happen on the original N64 hardware. If you don't
agree with this type of design, try the Ares N64 emulator instead: https://ares-emu.net/

And if you want to play ROMhacks, this is the right emulator for them. ROMhacks hosted at the URL below:
https://github.com/BruceShankleIV/Project64-1.6.2-ROMhacks-Collection This emulator will also work great
with retail games assuming they have been tested and have optimized emulation settings and plugins used.

See Section#4 Running ROMhacks if you are running ROMhacks not hosted above, and remember to check your
ROM Notes tab after loading a game to see what plugin(s) should be used with the game or hack.

Note: ROMhacks at https://github.com/BruceShankleIV/Project64-1.6.2-ROMhacks-Collection may be sometimes
updated so be sure to revisit it once a year or so to check the commit history for updates to the hacks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section#2 Hardware Compatibility
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program was originally designed on very old versions of Windows which Version 1.6.2 doesn't support
anymore. Version 1.6.2 was developed with a Windows 10 Gaming PC and isn't expected to function properly
on older versions of Windows like Windows 2000 and Windows 95. Theoretically, this program may work on a
Windows XP machine but will necessitate removing plugins which do not work on XP from the plugin folder.

However, even if you have an older or lower-end Computer, the app should function with it for some games
assuming you are using the default Jabo plugins. Some good games to try are Mario 64, Ocarina of Time, &
Majora's Mask. Suggested ROMhacks are Star Road (Super Mario 64) and The Missing Link (Ocarina of Time).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section#3 Plugin Details
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DISCLAIMER: Please DO NOT add any plugins to the plugin folder or it could results in all kinds of bugs.

Game compatibility: If you're looking for what set of plugins will work with the most games, here it is:

Video (graphics plugin: GLideN64 rev.xxxxxxx - May still need Jabo's Direct3D8 sometimes.

Audio (sound) plugin: Shankle's LINK's AziAudio [SEP2023] (1.0) - Good unless your PC can't support it.

Input (controller) plugin: Shankle's N-Rage's DirectInput8 1.6.2 - Good unless your PC can't support it.

RSP (reality signal processor) plugin: Project64 Legacy Icepir8's RSP - Usually subpar. May still need
				       static interpreter RSP for some cases like Stadium GB Tower.

***********************NOTE***********************
You are usually better off using the RSP Emulation
Plugin as the RSP instead of Icepir8's RSP for its
much higher performance, and better looking video.

The N-Rage Input plugin will need controller 2 and
N64 Mouse enabled for some niche ROMhacks to work,
but can breaks other games so it's off by default.

N-Rage may not work on some computers.

N-Rage uses F/G keys to allow precision aiming for
keyboard users, this is extremely handy!

N-Rage is typically sub-optimal for XInput devices
and another Input plugin should be used for those.

N-Rage does not have a setup mode like the default
input does so if you want something which is quick
to configure for your device, you should stay with
the default input plugin if you want a fast setup.
***********************NOTE***********************


Video (graphics) plugin:

Glide64 'Final' Date: Dec 29 2011 - AKA International Emulation Project, this plugin uses OpenGL so it's
				    not as well supported as Direct3D and Rice's video plugins but works
				    for PC's which support OpenGL. It suffers from a slow initialization
				    time and broken lighting in some games like Zelda. Filtering changes
				    at random and I'm not really sure why, it's a very annoying bug that
				    messes up all the textures. The only reason to use this plugin is to
				    perform GIM in Zelda by disabling "Enable frame buffer emulation" or
				    because a ROMhack benefits most from it (3rd Quest Patch 0.5 - using
				    "Enable frame buffer emulation" turned OFF, or a ROMhack has alpha
				    blending or framebuffer issues and your PC doesn't support GLiden64,
				    or you don't want to deal with the bugs in GLideN64). If you develop
				    ROMhacks, please do not do it while using this as your video plugin,
				    because it's so buggy and poorly supported. Also causes input delay.
				    This is the 2nd best video plugin here.

GLideN64 rev.xxxxxxx - This is probably the 3rd best video plugin included, only ranking 3rd place since
		       GLideN64 has even worse PC support than Glide64, Glide64 has bad support already.
		       Some games are still better off using the LLE video plugin, it is game-dependent!
		       There's also a lot of fullscreen tearing and input delay with the plugin whenever
		       framebuffer is emulated, and framebuffer is needed for a lot of games. Just stick
		       to Jabo's Direct3D8 or Glide64 unless a hack needs GLideN64. This plugin supports
		       less ROMhacks than Glide64 as well and has numerous regressions from his Glide64.
		       This plugin is also named similarly to Glide64, but it's not related. It's a hack
		       of another video plugin named glN64 which is one of the worst video plugins ever.
		       Despite all these drawbacks, the video plugin looks great. So if your PC supports
		       it and you don't mind the screen tearing, input delay, and bad hack support, give
		       this one a try and cross your fingers for good luck.
		       Note: This plugin supports GIM by turning off "Emulate framebuffer" like Glide64.

Jabo's Direct3D8 1.6.2 - This is the best video plugin here as it's the only one capable of all of this:
			* No screen tearing in fullscreen
			* No input delay
			* Works with all older ROMhacks
			* Works on all Windows PC's
			* Framebuffer support for Ocarina/Majora, Mario Kart 64, Kazooie/Tooie, etc.
			* Supports native widescreen with adjusted aspect (effectiveness varies by game)
			* Supports super sampling anti-aliasing with FSAA (effectiveness varies by game)
			 Unfortunately, this video plugin doesn't perform well with newer ROMhacks which
			 were made with tools that import textures which won't get proper alpha blending
			 in this plugin or uses a microcode not supported by this plugin like F3DEX3. In
			 these cases you should use another video plugin. Otherwise, just use this if it
			 is effective for the game you're trying to run. To setup the widescreen, enable
			 the, "Adjust game aspect ratio to match yours", from the plugin's advanced tab.
			Note: This is a Hex edit of Jabo's 1.6.1 from jabosoft.com/blog/project64-update
			Entering fullscreen after PC unlocking or after a window pops up fixes freezing.
			Note: Use Direct3D transformation pipeline seems to work good for Majora's Mask,
			but due to a bug in the plugin it doesn't save this setting.

Jabo's Legacy Direct3D - If you have an old (legacy) PC which doesn't even work properly with Direct3D8,
			 use this. This uses the Legacy pixel pipeline and renders with Direct3D9. Other
			 than that, it's the same as Jabo's Direct3D8. Generally there's no reason using
			 this unless graphics don't show up with Jabo's Direct3D8 on your PC since there
			 are wrong colors and sometimes missing graphical effects like Zelda monochrome.
			 Sometimes it's better than Direct3D8 on a game-specific basis, working slightly
			 better for Ocarina of Time, but worse in Majora's Mask case for example.
			 Notably gets SM64 shadows and sun mat to render on Intel GPU's.
			 Rank: Tied with Glide64 for 2nd place, as it is usually worse than D3D8 1.6.2,
			 but still not as many issues as GLideN64.

Project64 Legacy Icepir8's LLE - This plugin is very buggy but I decided to include it since it's pretty
				 faithful to original N64 graphics due to its use of low level emulation
				 and it being a fork of Angrylion's RDP, the most accurate video plugin.
				 Note: some games will need Icepir8's RSP in order to boot whenever this
				 video plugin is used, or some which need Ice's RSP regardless of video.
				 Rank: Tied with GLideN64 for 3rd place, as it has about the same number
				 of bugs, even if it doesn't suffer from the constant stuttering or tear
				 artifacts it still has performance problems and even worse hack support
				 in-part due to LLE and from an incomplete framebuffer implementation.

Rice's Video Plugin 6.1.1 beta 10 - Undoubtedly the WORST video plugin here (4th place)! Although it was
				    the first ever video plugin supporting high resolution texture packs
				    but sadly was discontinued by Rice. It suffers from numerous issues,
				    thus there is very little reason to use it:
				    * You want to perform GIM but your PC doesn't work with Glide/GLideN
				    * You want texture packs but your PC doesn't work with Glide/GLideN
				    This video plugin also supports newer hacks like Ultimate Trial with
				    the Basic Render-to-texture N64 Frame Buffer Effect Emulation Option
				    (you need to uncheck Hide Advanced Options and enable for per-game).
				    An ini has been provided with basic configs for Majora and Mario 64.


Audio (sound) plugin:

Jabo's DirectSound 1.6.2 - The most PC compatible sound plugin. If a game won't boot using this plugin,
			   but the same game is able to boot whilst using No Audio or Shankle Azi, there
			   are two settings in the ROM Settings tab, which either of them can be toggled
			   to fix a ROM boot issue: "Sync Game to Audio" and "Jabo AI". Turning the Sync
			   setting off should be tried first, if the results aren't good then you should
			   turn Jabo AI on and see if the ROM sounds or performs better (no stuttering).
			   Either option will also be used to fix a game running at the wrong speed with
			   this sound plugin, as by default, the emulator syncs game speed to the audio.
			Note: This is a Hex edit of Jabo's 1.6.1 from jabosoft.com/blog/project64-update
		Note: The emulator can slowdown dramatically if your sound device is unplugged with this
		due to Sync Game to Audio. If this happens, all you have to do is plug back in and wait.

No Audio plugin - Use this plugin when you want to hear nothing. It is better than having the volume all
		  the way down in Azi because in Azi it is not always mute making this your best choice.

Shankle's LINK's AziAudio [SEP2023] (1.0) - Great general-use option and sound plugin used for GLideN64.
					    However, this plugin can have issues with some computers, so
					    then you would use Jabo's DirectSound with those edge cases.


Input (controller) plugin:

Jabo's DirectInput7 1.6.2 - Unless this is your preferred input plugin for its ease of setup, you should
			    use a different input plugin if your PC supports a different input plugin...
			    It's bad for keyboard because there is no binding to allow precision aiming.
			    It's bad for controllers because of its high outer range. And to top it off,
			    it's not even backwards compatible with older Joy Stick Save files from 1.6.
			    Despite all the negatives, this is the default since it works for everybody.
			    Note: also, this won't work for any games that depend entirely on N64 Mouse,
			    or which depend on a Pak type not supported by this input plugin.

Shankle's N-Rage's DirectInput8 1.6.2 - Enable XInput if your device uses XInput (Xbox 360 Controllers).
					This is a very solid plugin, a few games need it to work at all.
					But Octomino SDL2 could be used when using an XInput controller,
					so long as the game is compatible with the Octomino SDL2 plugin.
					Use F and G keys to modify range for keyboard precision aimings.

Shankle's Octomino SDL2 Input 0.1.1 (1.0) - Plug and play plugin, no configuration needed. It's config'd
					    through configuring controller plugin after a ROM is opened.
					    It has many options, some not even seen in N-Rage, and auto-
					    configures your controller using the gamecontroller database
					    so you will not have to map out all of your button mappings.
					    Some games require you to use N-Rage's input plugin however.
			    Note: also, this won't work for any games that depend entirely on N64 Mouse,
			    or which depend on a Pak type not supported by this input plugin.


RSP (reality signal processor) plugin:

Project64 Legacy Icepir8's RSP - Only use this RSP when you have to because it's very prone to slowdown.
				 It is only needed for super niche games (indicated by Game.ini) so stay
				 with the default RSP plugin unless a game specifically needs to use it.
				 To know when you need to use this RSP, always view a ROM's Plugin Note!

RSP Emulation Plugin - The most compatible, use this unless Icepir8's RSP is needed for a specific game,
		       or if Icepir8's RSP is needed for a game with Icepir8's LLE (usually, it is not).
		       Note: This is a hex edit of the 1.6 RSP and syncs with the app with the dll name.

Static Interpreter - Currently only needed for GameBoy transfer pak emulation. Added to the project last
		     minute, unknown how this one behaves.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section#4 Running ROMhacks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: If you ran into a crash while trying to play a ROMhack with an unregistered game entry, like pause
crashed an Ocarina of Time ROMhack, or the ROMhack just will not boot at all, you need to uncheck, "Hide
Advanced Settings", go to the ROM Settings tab, and set Counter Factor from "Default" to 2 (to fix pause
issues/or game not booting), and if that isn't enough then also try setting Register Caching to, "OFF"!!
Remember to apply the setting as specified by the emulator (if the game is running, you need to reset)!!

A lot of ROMhacks should work meh with default settings/registries, but if you want to get the most bang
for your buck, you need to learn how to setup ROM Settings for the ROMhack and/or modify the hack itself
to take advantage of per-game hacks in Jabo's Direct3D8. To get per-game settings with Jabo's Direct3D8,
you need to either change the checksum of the ROMhack to match with the original game it was hacked off,
or change the internal name to match it. For example, if someone creates an Ocarina of Time v1.0 ROMhack
or an Ocarina of Time v1.1/v1.2 ROMhack, you would ensure the internal name of the ROMhack reads as, THE
LEGEND OF ZELDA to match with the original game, getting D3D8 to emulate effects (sun/pause/monochrome).
The same will apply for GLideN64 which also currently checks the ROM's internal name for per-game hacks.

For Zelda ROMHACKS, Majora's Mask hacks should always use the same internal name as their baserom, which
is either ZELDA MAJORA'S MASK or THE MASK OF MUJURA. THE LEGEND OF ZELDA should get used for all Ocarina
of Time ROMhacks that are based off of all release ROMs like Version 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 and for all hacks
which use monochrome, like during a flashback cutscene, or the sepia filter at the very end of the game.

Then you would setup a ROM Database entry which can vary drastically from the original game depending on
how much the hack differs from the original game with a Cheat0 added to fix any emulation/plugin issues.
If you need help using the ROM Database, contact an advanced/experienced user or N64 developer to debug.

Note: the ROMhacks on the Project64 1.6.2 ROMhacks Collection repository not found in the unlisted shall
already have ini entries, so you just need to make sure you look at the ROM Notes and make sure you have
the right plugins in use, and then you will be able to play the game if your PC supports them plugin(s).

Flickering Note: a few games may have flickering with Jabo's Direct3D8. This bug can be fixed by setting
Counter Factor to 1 and in some cases, also making sure that CF1-->0 is ON/enabled in your ROM Settings.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section#5 How to Use The ROM Browser/ROM Notes System
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ROM browser system, controlled by Game.ini, is supposed to work like this:

You select your ROM directory and then all those ROMs will be loaded in the ROM browser. They get marked
with colors based on compatibility. Green would indicate that it works with any of the included plugins.
Yellow would indicate that at least one video, audio, input, or RSP plugin is needed for you to play it.
Red indicates the game is illegit somehow and I ask you not to play these, do not want to be associated.

Green - Compatible

Yellow - Semicompatible

Red - Illegit

The user should refer to the plugin note for Semicompatible games if given to see what plugin(s) to use.
The user should refer to the plugin note for Compatible games if given to see viable plugin suggestions.
The plugin note will be found from the settings window after opening the ROM in the ROM Notes section or
from the ROM Notes window which appears from right clicking the ROM after it gets loaded in the browser.
And the core notes are there to make the user aware of noticeable core (emulation) issues ahead of time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section#6 Emulator Advanced Settings Overview
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After unchecking Hide Advanced Settings under Settings->Options and reloading the Settings window, there
will be a ROM Settings tab. The tab is looking at the currently loaded Game's CRC inside PJ64DB\Game.ini
and showing you what emulation options are enabled for the game, what emulation options are disabled for
the game, and what emulation options are forced ON or forced OFF due to another setting. This section of
the guide shall give you a quick rundown on the default settings tab and all twenty of the ROM Settings!

Note: You can fine-tune default settings for better compatibility by setting Register Caching OFF,
and Counter Factor set to 2. However, Register Caching ON is usually good to get better framerate,
and Counter Factor set to 2 can cause flickering, longer load times, and significant lag increase.


CPU Core Style: By default, Recompiler but changeable from the advanced tab to Interpreter
* Forces CF1-->0 off if set to Interpreter
* Forces Align DMA on if set to Interpreter
The Recompiler and the Interpreter have a big performance difference between each other, especially when
Register Caching is set ON for the Recompiler. The Interpreter also generally (but not always) is closer
to replicating N64 hardware and its limitations, as such it has generally worse ROMhack game support and
should never be used if you are able to get a game working with the Recompiler. The Interpreter can't be
affected by Self-modifying Code Method, Register Caching, or CF1-->0, they're recompiler style-specific!

Memory Size: By default, 8MB but changeable from the advanced tab to 4MB
If set to 8MB, it is like having an expansion pak in. However, if a game doesn't benefit from or require
the expansion pak, it is better to set it to 4MB to avoid memory waste and reduce size on the savestates.

Self-modifying Code Method: By default, Check Memory but changeable from the advanced tab
* Disabled by the Interpreter
Protect Memory is reliable but slow and sometimes has severe performance issues for specific ROMs. Check
Memory isn't as reliable but it's a lot faster, and is the original PJ64 1.6 default. Check & Set Memory
is a specialized version of Check Memory which also does custom setting of memory due to a 1.6 core bug.
Cache is the least reliable but you can encounter a case where Cache is the only method that works for a
game to boot at all seen with Rat Attack if using the alternative ROM Settings for single player gaming.

Register Caching: By default, off but changeable from the advanced tab
*Disabled by the Interpreter
This gives a big performance boost to the Recompiler and usually works without issue, however it can bug
out plugins and cause seemingly random game crashes or weird behavior, so it's only to be used when safe
to do so. If you're an advanced user, have it OFF by default from the advanced tab to prioritize compat,
otherwise set it ON to prioritize the best performance. ON is for performance, OFF is for compatibility.

Counter Factor: By default, 2 but changeable from the advanced tab
* Forces CF1-->0 off if not set to 1
Another very game-dependent setting, this essentially just adds lag. This is needed for some games to be
stable, for others it breaks them completely or causes extreme flickering (video plugin dependent). 2 is
a safe default so it's not suggested you go any lower (or higher) from this unless you are playing games
that you are confident require 3 or will work with 1. Setting to 1 will notably get rid of some flickers
and cause faster loading times and you will never have any lag in a game.
WARNING: Having this too low or too high can cause Limit FPS off to crash (game and plugin-dependent)!!!

Save Type: Varies by default
The emulator usually correctly figures out the right save type but assumes 4kbit for EEPROM, not 16kbit.
This means all games which require 16kbit EEPROM need to have the save type manually set in the Game.ini
from the ROM Settings, or type it. You may also need to specify FlashRAM or 256kbit SRAM for some games.
You can however autodetect to 16kbit EEPROM from the advanced tab if this suits your usage of Project64.

Sync Game to Audio: By default, on
* Forced off if sound plugin isn't Jabo's DirectSound
* Forced on by Jabo AI
* Forces Limit FPS on while a game is running
This setting is needed for Jabo's DirectSound to not sound awful in popular titles. It works differently
from the Sync game to Audio option in the audio config, which allows the user to enable per-ROM from the
registries and also does not work for some games which this Sync Game to Audio will work for. Some games
don't work with this option and either run too slowly or refuse to boot. For these games, turn Sync Game
to Audio off and listen to the sound, then enable Jabo AI and use whichever worked better.

Jabo AI: By default, off
* Forced off if sound plugin isn't Jabo's DirectSound
* Forces Sync Game to Audio on
Just like Azi AI described below but for Jabo_Dsound, also a good substitute for Sync Game to Audio if a
ROM doesn't work well with Sync Game to Audio on/off by itself, or if this fixes Jabo_Dsound stuttering.

Azi AI: By default, off
* Forced off if sound plugin isn't Shankle AziAudio
This emulates AI for Shankle AziAudio, used to get sound working in some games or to solve Limit FPS off
issues while using the Shankle AziAudio plugin.

Legacy AiLenChanged: By default, off
* Forced off if sound plugin is No audio
This is an alternate AI function from Project64 Legacy 1.6.3/1.6.4 which works better for certain games.

RSP Recompiler: By default, off
* Forced on if video plugin isn't Icepir8's LLE or the ROM Internal name is a Zelda one
The Project64 1.6 RSP has a Recompiler and an Interpreter just like the Project64 CPU Core Style. In many
but not all cases, the Interpreter style works better with Icepir8's LLE and prevents strange crashes. To
solve this, the Interpreter style will always be used and the Recompiler style will be used for the cases
where Interpreter does not work well with Icepir8's LLE. This is due to lack of time to fully test games.

TLB: By default, on
*Forced on by the Interpreter
This Translation Lookaside Buffer is either required for a game or not. If the game does not require it,
it's best to turn it off to avoid issues that this setting can cause, although with most games it's fine
to leave it on. Generally, just leave this on unless you know a game works better with, or needs it off.
Turning it off notably improves performance and can get ROMhacks working.

Signal: By default, off
It's either needed or it's not. The setting is needed for some games to boot.

59Hz: By default, off
This setting fixes a game running at the wrong speed (misdetected as 50Hz) but this is very very rare...
There is currently only one game which needs this setting, but there could be more in the future.

CF1-->0: By default, on
* Forced off by the Interpreter or Counter Factor not set to 1
Counter Factor 1 is converted to Counter Factor 0, making it truly lagless, but also less stable, as the
more you lower the counter factor, the more likely you generally are to run into a game-dependent crash!
However, having it turned on can be necessary to emulate some games properly or to get rid of lagging or
delay like the equipment subscreen equip delay in Ocarina of Time on HLE video if not using a Cheat0.

Align DMA: By default, off
*Forced on by the Interpreter
This setting fixes broken interface positions in games but also emulates a limitation breaking ROMhacks.
There is currently only one game which needs this setting, but there could be more in the future.

Delay RDP: By default, off
It's either needed or it's not. Notably fixes the HUD in Kirby 64 for some reason. The setting is needed
for some games to boot.

Delay RSP: By default, off
It's either needed or it's not. The setting is needed for some games to boot. Known to break sound in
some games when used.

Delay SI: By default, off
It's either needed or it's not. Notably fixes GB Tower not working with the Static Interpreter RSP while
using N-Rage. The setting is needed for some games to boot.


The default area is just the defaults used for the ROM Settings whenever it says "Default".
Then there is the force settings, they are self-explanatory. Keep in mind that activating these settings
doesn't overwrite RDB entries so they're good for testing, but disactivating them can overwrite entries.

Section#7 Known Issues
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plugin-specific issues - This app relies on a lot of different plugins to work, many of them are closed-
source but have specific bugs in them which means issues specific to many of the plugins in the emulator
will likely never get resolved. All of the following plugins included in the emulator are closed-source:

Jabo's Direct3D8 1.6.2
Jabo's Legacy Direct3D
Project64 Legacy Icepir8's LLE

Jabo's DirectSound 1.6.2
No Audio plugin

Jabo's DirectInput7 1.6.2

Project64 Legacy Icepir8's RSP
RSP Emulation Plugin

Glide64 and Rice are open source but I cannot get them to compile.

IMPORTANT: Plugin-hardware-specific issues - Some issues you see with a plugin may be specific to YOUR
device only! For example, in Majora's Mask on a 4 years old GTX 1660 TI, TrulyNaN reports the GI model
for Anju's letter to kafei does not display and the Don Gero's mask eye textures do not display right.
If you see this or something similar, try changing to another video plugin. If shadows or some texture
don't show up in Mario 64, you can change to Jabo's Legacy Direct3D to resolve it. In other cases like
TrulyNaN's, you can try changing to Project64 Legacy LLE or GLideN64 if they are supported by your PC.

Limit FPS off glitches - Some games crash when you set Limit FPS off or the sound can get super screwed.

Cheat code issues - The cheat codes in this emulator have not been extensively tested, it's likely there
are some bad codes which may cause crashes or don't behave correctly due to lack of testing and whatnot.
But the one's for Mario 64, Ocarina of Time, and Majora's Mask have been tested well.

Input delay with GLideN64 when framebuffer is on and with Icepir8's LLE. To resolve this for GLideN64 w/
SM64 Hacks, ensure the internal name of the ROMhack is, "SUPER MARIO 64" if it does not use framebuffer.
Note: You can update internal names of ROMhacks using a simple hex editor like HxD, and the CRC as well!

GLideN64 fullscreen tearing. No good fix for this, the Vsync option won't even help. Turning framebuffer
off fixes this but having it off by default will break graphics in hundreds of games.

Core timing issues (usage of Counter Factor), not major though just can be annoying.

Stuff in the app doesn't work in fullscreen, although you can access a lot of things using hotkeys.

Minor emulation issues but nothing super concerning - See Core Note= in Game.ini.

Section#9 Special Thanks & Shoutouts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are my special thanks and shoutouts to awesome people for their work, assistance, and/or kindness:

Miroku - Your RAM hacking skills have been extremely useful to this project with improved cheat support,
	 reduced pause delay, instant load times, and zero lag thanks to your RAM hackings. Thanks Miro!

z64me - For being supportive and addressing issues during the project's primitive stages when I started.

aglab2 - I'm so glad that you researched and documented about the vulnerability inside of N64 emulators.
	 Thanks to your amazing discovery, hacktarux made a fix to the vulnerability in Project64 V 1.6.
	 Not only that, but your Legacy fork was referenced for Project64 V1.6.2 to get improvements in.
	 Thank you for contributing valuable code which has been used to improve everyone's experiences.

gaudy-twinned0z@icloud.com / clickdevin - Thanks so much for developing the Octomino SDL plugin, and for
					  giving me the tip I needed for building. You really rock dude!

TrulyNan - "1.6 Shankle's Final Cut Gigachad Version will save us all." I love that enthusiasm of yours!

lilycatx - You're a very kind person and I especially thank you for making an awesome translation! ♥ :)

satannintendo - You have had a good attitude ever since we met, and thanks so much for your translation!

Brian W. - For remembering the day I turned 21. Thanks for wishing happy birthday, you're a good friend!

Bruce Shankle III - For helping me learn to use Visual Studio when I first started this project, and for
                    helping me obtain an Uninterruptible Power Supply which has helped out tremendously.
                    Later on, he setup high speed internet to help me manage code and develop Project64.
		    Not just that, but he cleaned up my living space after it became a wasteland because
		    I was focusing so much on this project. He is a great father to me.

Emmanuel Sturdivant - He gave me candy he found at the bottom of a vending machine. A heart of kindness.

l0lgamez - You were a great tester!

MTA - Thanks for checking out the project and notably suggesting a chinese fan translation of MM to add!

TheGent & Smiff - Although both of your work on the original Database support files has been obsolete by
		  now, I can't go without saying how you put a lot of time into it which is respectable.
		  Good job to you two for investing so much into your original works.

Zilmar - You programmed the core in Project64 1.6 from what I can understand. Thanks to your significant
	 work on that, this project can exist and enable so many other game projects to remain playable.
	 Thank you, for allowing this to be possible. And good luck with your builds, even if your users
	 cannot trust you anymore after you back-stabbed them.

Jabo - Thanks for making such an outstanding video plugin with very little drawbacks compared to others.
