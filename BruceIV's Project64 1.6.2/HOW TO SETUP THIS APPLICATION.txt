Note - You do not need to run exception.bat to set a Win Defender exception
if your Windows PC ISN'T using Windows Defender, skip the next two sections
if this is the case for you.

HOW TO INSTALL: Run Exception.bat with admin priviledge if you have windows
defender (some PC's don't in which case the file will not have any effect).

To confirm you have an exception set for the emulator directory, press your
Win key and type "virus" and press Enter to reach the Virus & threat
protection settings. Click on Manage Settings, scroll down, click on Add or
remove exclusions. Now it will show all locations on your PC which have
exceptions from defender scanning. If you see the path to the emulator
here, it means you have an exception set and Windows Defender will avoid
scanning it so it can function properly. If you have any other apps which
malfunction from the defender, set exceptions for those.

You can extract Project64.exe from Project64.zip now and play an N64 game.
Then launch the Project64.exe and finish your setup by loading a game, and
selecting plugins based on provided Plugin Notes and reviewing how plugins
work with your hardware. Jabo's Direct3D8 works best for my PC for Ocarina
of Time & Majora's Mask N64 versions. See the user guide if you need help.

THE PASSWORD TO THE PROJECT64 ZIP FILES IS password
*Make sure you extract the .exe to the same directory as this .txt file.


END OF HOW TO INSTALL


The password to Apps.zip (bundled alongside this zip) is also password.
