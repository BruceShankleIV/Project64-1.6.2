"Don't Play"

This section of the Project64 1.6.2 repository adds patches for games that I suggest you don't play. The reasons I think it's best you
do not play these games varies. I'll start by going through in alphabetical order to explain why I suggest not to play these ROMhacks.



Hateful Star Revenge Hacks

These ROMhacks were made with tools developed by SKELUX, but despite using his work to develop Star Revenge, they trash talk his name.
"Trashlux" "the memetrash Skelux"


B3313 Unabandoned

What do you get when you harass the developer because you are too impatient to wait for them to finish their ROMhack to such an extent
that they are compelled to tell you they have abandoned the project to get you to leave them alone so they might be able to develop it
in peace, and you respond to this by going out of your way to hijack his entire project by taking as much work from him as you can for
you to make your own rendition of his project, and then when he finally finishes his project, you and everybody else who sabotages his
project decides to harass and bully him nonstop? You get B3313 Unabandoned.


SM64 Decades Later

This is what the author of this ROMhack has had to say about themselves:
"That one german guy that made the Star Revenge Series and remade vanilla SM64 to be finally a good game."

I would like you to look closely. "remade vanilla SM64 to be finally a good game". What is the implication? It is the implication that
Super Mario 64 is not a good game, and that their ROMhack of it, which they call "Decades Later", is a good game. This is an insult to
the legacy of Super Mario 64 and such an arrogant comment because without Super Mario 64's engine and base, their hack couldn't exist.
I therefore cannot recommend anyone play this hack. It's inherently mean spirited towards the original game and I shall never play it.


Star Road Retooled

The about section for this ROMhack says this:

"An overhauled reassembly of Star Road, featuring many enhancements and technical upgrades from the original! Contains many design
alterations intended to improve the experience, especially for new players"

But this is actually a hijacked version of the original game. None of the design alterations and code changes were approved by the
author of the Star Road video game. We call this copyright infringement in the industry. An explanation of which is provided here:

"What is copyright infringement?

As a general matter, copyright infringement occurs when a copyrighted work is reproduced, distributed, performed, publicly
displayed, or made into a derivative work without the permission of the copyright owner."

"When is my work protected?

Your work is under copyright protection the moment it is created and fixed in a tangible form that it is perceptible either
directly or with the aid of a machine or device."

This hijacked version also improperly credits SKELUX, the primary author of Star Road. While reading over the credits on the sign,
the first thing you'll see is "Super Mario Star Road Retooled by Pyro Jay". SKELUX isn't listed until later alongside other names.
I therefore cannot recommend anyone play this hack. It's not lawful and known to have many issues and poor design choices anyways.


Super Ice 64

The only reason not to play this ROMhack is because of the people who made it, which are the people who refer to themselves as the
Project64 Team. Gent (the leader of the former Project64 Team), has continously attempted to deceive people about Project64 1.6.2.
He has made false claims about the existence of Project64 1.6.1 (which they renamed as 1.6 Plus and uploaded onto a public GitHub)
and tried to deceive others into thinking they cannot fork their public GitHub and has even gone on to claim they aren't credited.


Super Mario 65

Cursed.


Super Mario Star Road N64
A supposed N64 compatible version of Super Mario Star Road, but isn't fully compatible or permitted by Star Road's author, SKELUX.
It also has many poor design choices and seems to be based on an older buggier version of the game, the worst experience possible.
No reason to ever play this since it's not actually hardware compatible and is another unauthorized republishing of SKELUX's work.
