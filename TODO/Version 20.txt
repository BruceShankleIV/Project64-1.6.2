more hack support

pmem entries to review, see if we can get working on cache of check mem

^ what we really need to do is go through each game, optimizing counter factor and scm.

reg caching and cpu type is already done, cf and scm are the main things
ai settings/sync game can be added wherever it benefits

make setmem a ROM Setting if needed if TLOZ auto isn't enough

fix gliden64 gfx for RE2 with .custom setting somehow?
