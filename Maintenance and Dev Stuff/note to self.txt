we need to use the project64 dd archive in order to get pokemon stadium compatibility:
project64 1.6.1 lost pokemon stadium compatibility. however we obviously can't develop
off of project64 dd because it has its own bugs (star road pipe crash for example) and
would take too long to implement improvements made for project64 1.6.1. our mission is
to find what in this code exists to get compatibility with pokemon stadium (U) (v1.0).
