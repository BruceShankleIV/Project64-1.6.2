NOTE: I have included the Return to Yoshi's Island Demo 2, but I don't plan to upstream it
because I'd rather wait until the whole game is released and then I'll just go from there.
Also, this may not be updated regularly outside of gamecontrollerdb as the ROMhacks aren't
being updated regularly hence they should really only be checked on every blue moon or so.
