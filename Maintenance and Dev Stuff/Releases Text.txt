Canary build for my Project64 1.6.2 emulator, a fork of Project64 1.6.1 which has been renamed as "1.6 Plus".

To the casual player, download the InstallerWiz. To translators, download the Translator's Sample to make your translation off of (english characters only, delete any lines which mean the same in english/aren't any different in your language). To people with bad PC's who are unable to use more demanding plugins needed to emulate certain graphical effects that aren't handled properly by Jabo's Direct3D8, either upgrade your specs or try out the Bad plugins for bad PC's patch (‚ö†but beware that these plugins are bad because they are unstable/prone to crashes ‚ö†).

Beware of windows virus false positives. Please read this:

Windows Security's Virus & threat protection can interfere with this installer wizard and potentially Project64.exe itself. I highly suggest disabling real-time protection under Virus & threat protection settings before installing 1.6.2. After installing 1.6.2 from this InstallerWiz, scroll to the bottom, click "Add or remove exclusions", click "Add an exclusion", click "Folder", then single-click on the Project64 1.6.2 folder and press "Select Folder". Once you have done all that, re-enable real-time protection to turn your antivirus back on.
