Note 1: From WIP 7 V7 onward, CloseCpu function is no longer using Sleep(50); and this may cause the emulator to sometimes crash during plugin hot swaps. This has yet to be confirmed. More testing is needed. If you encounter a crash while plugin hot swapping please report the bug. Leave a comment on YouTube, send me a DM, open an issue on GitHub, email me, anything to let me know about it or any other undocumented issues you come across while using my Project64 1.6.2.

Note 2: I have stopped trying to support the GLideN64 video plugin because it is really buggy and not worth investing in. However, this still comes with ANGLE GLideN64 which you can use for SM64 ROMhacks, and you can use Mk3 GLideN64 from the bad plugins for bad PC's patch if you really want to use GLideN64, but I'm telling you it is buggy and you're better off using Icepir8's LLE video plugin instead!

To the casual player, download the InstallerWiz. To translators, download the Translator's Sample to make your translation off of (english characters only, delete any lines which mean the same in english/aren't any different in your language). To people with bad PC's who are unable to use more demanding plugins needed to emulate certain graphical effects that aren't handled properly by Jabo's Direct3D8, either upgrade your specs or try out the Bad plugins for bad PC's patch (‚ö†but beware that these plugins are bad because they are unstable/prone to crashes ‚ö†).

Beware of windows virus false positives. Please read this:

Windows Security's Virus & threat protection can interfere with this installer wizard and potentially Project64.exe itself. I highly suggest disabling real-time protection under Virus & threat protection settings before installing 1.6.2. After installing 1.6.2 from this InstallerWiz, scroll to the bottom, click "Add or remove exclusions", click "Add an exclusion", click "Folder", then single-click on the Project64 1.6.2 folder and press "Select Folder". Once you have done all that, re-enable real-time protection to turn your antivirus back on.

A new document detailing how to develop Project64 1.6 and going over my troubling experience with the MiB/PJ64Team organizations has been released.
