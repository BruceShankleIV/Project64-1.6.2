Hyperlinks are blocked, don't bother including them. This is for security reasons only (a site could be harmful to the end-user as it is or if it changes in the future).

In the case that your plugin is required or best fit for a game, it's highly suggested you mention to the user to use your plugin as a plugin note in the RDB for all
relevant games which benefit from your plugin. An example of this case would be ANGLE GLideN64 for Super Mario 64 and Super Mario 64 ROMhacks.

You should bundle a low level RSP like ParaLLel RSP if you make a low level video plugin for this emulator as the on-board low level RSP has speed issues,
it was only included because I wanted the most accurate RSP plugin to be able to support all the N64 games.
