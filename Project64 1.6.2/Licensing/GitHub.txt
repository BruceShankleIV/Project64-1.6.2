GitHub Terms of Service Section 5. License Grant to Other Users

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and
contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting
your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and
"fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of
Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User
of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your
Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub
as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You
may grant further rights if you adopt a license. If you are uploading Content you
did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you
upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.
