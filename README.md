BUG/ISSUE REPORTING: To report any unknown issues (not documented in known issues section), here's a few ways. They are ordered from most to least effective:

1: Send me a direct message through Discord. This is the best way to get my attention if you really need something looked at. Do not attempt to DM me if you have been blocked. I'm on discord at bruceshankle

2: Open an issue on GitHub. I'm not very familiar with GitHub and am very new to it at the moment so this may not be a great idea. If you make an issue here, try to notify me, otherwise it may not get noticed depending on how GitHub notifications work.

3: Send me an email through gmail. I don't check my email very often at all anymore, but here it is: bruceiv.shankle@gmail.com

VULNERABILITY REPORTING: Rumor has it that there are more vulnerabilities in Project64 1.6 which just aren't talked about. If they are real and you know about one of these vulnerabilities, please DM me on discord at bruceshankle or open an issue about it on GitHub and make sure I am notified so I am made aware of it, then we can start thinking about how it might be able to be fixed.


About: Project64 1.6.2 is my unofficial update and spiritual successor to Project64 Versions 1.6 and 1.6.1 developed using PJ64Team's vulnerability fixed (but kinda bugged) 1.6 Plus as it stood at this time: https://github.com/pj64team/Project64-1.6-Plus/tree/7ff51997c16e35a1c0685cc076b085ee6eda1b64 (Plus is based on the source code for 1.6.1, hence my rebranding to 1.6.2)



There is some misinformation about this project not being licensed and forks of it being prohibited, despite this code being labelled "free" and "open source" upon the release that 1.6.2's source was developed from. Please see GitHub Terms of Service: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#5-license-grant-to-other-users and review the license that comes with the code as written below.
