Project64 1.6.2 is my unofficial update/spiritual successor to Project64 1.6/1.6.1 developed using PJ64Team's vulnerability fixed (but kinda bugged) version known as 1.6 Plus as it stood at this time: https://github.com/pj64team/Project64-1.6-Plus/tree/7ff51997c16e35a1c0685cc076b085ee6eda1b64 (Plus is based on the source code for 1.6.1, hence my rebranding to 1.6.2)
