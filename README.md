Project64 1.6.2 is a deployment-ready software-based Nintendo 64 emulator developed by Edwin Bruce Shankle IV from the source code of Project64 1.6.1/1.6 Plus. This does not target hardware or PD roms. Project64 1.6.2's specialty is with playing non-hardware compatible romhacks (typically older one's) and running on low-end Windows computers which lack the necessary specs required for accurate emulation. This emulator has received one vulnerability fix, but there could be other vulnerabilities highlighted in the future so be on the lookout! If a vulnerability does get discovered and it doesn't get addressed on this repo should I be busy doing something else, feel free to make a fork and fix it yourself. Just include the license in your distributions and don't profit off of the code and you'll be fine.

BUG/ISSUE REPORTING: To report any unknown issues (not documented in known issues section), here's a few ways. They are ordered from most to least effective:

1: Send me a direct message through Discord. This is the best way to get my attention if you really need something looked at. Do not attempt to DM me if you have been blocked. I'm on discord at bruceshankle

2: Open an issue on GitHub. I'm not very familiar with GitHub and am very new to it at the moment so this may not be a great idea. If you make an issue here, try to notify me, otherwise it may not get noticed depending on how GitHub notifications work.

3: Send me an email through gmail. I don't check my email very often at all anymore, but here it is: bruceiv.shankle@gmail.com

VULNERABILITY REPORTING: Rumor has it that there are more vulnerabilities in Project64 1.6 which just aren't talked about. If they are real and you know about one of these vulnerabilities, please DM me on discord at bruceshankle or open an issue about it on GitHub and make sure I am notified so I am made aware of it, then we can start thinking about how it might be able to be fixed.
