Review ifndef MIN_SIZE stuff as well as potential missing memory registers in r4300i_SW_NonMemory for ifndef MIN_SIZE

more hack support

Need to review ALL ENTRIES USING PROTECT MEMORY, can we use a lower scm setting to get working
better on lower end devices

may consider depreciating the entire self mod code method system, and just making a per rom setting
called "protect memory" (recompiler only), using check memory in place of everywhere cache is used.

We can also depreciate the mem size dropdown system. just always use 8mb by default, make 4mb a ROM
setting checkbox. There is not much reason a user would ever pick 4mb by default.
Alternatively, we could just never use 4mb at all, but 4mb is good for lower sizes and no mem waste

If cache is depreciated, update the core notes for rat attack entries

There is a perf diff between check mem and cache! Cache is faster than check mem for sure.
Could keep it as a checkbox per-rom setting. But maybe that perf diff isn't worth it?
cache sm64: 650 or 700ish
check mem: 600ish
the difference can be greater sometimes (game-dependent)

make "set memory" a ROM Setting if needed if TLOZ auto isn't enough (cannot be active with pmem if
self mod system is dropped since pmem doesn't execute code in the function block where setmem is done
inside the clear recomp)

games with scm change which need to be reviewed (a lot of these are cache/may not need to be reviewed
if cache is depreciated to eliminate self mod dropdown):
