Review ifndef MIN_SIZE stuff as well as potential missing memory registers in r4300i_SW_NonMemory for ifndef MIN_SIZE

more hack support
lookout for Paper Mario Code Name Abyss ROMhack
Check Mark Kurko, often uploads ROMhacks
Look in the demo's for ongoing projects, when those are complete we can upload the full version

Need to review ALL ENTRIES USING PROTECT MEMORY, can we use a lower scm setting to get working
better on lower end devices

make "set memory" a ROM Setting if needed if TLOZ auto isn't enough (cannot be active with pmem if
self mod system is dropped since pmem doesn't execute code in the function block where setmem is done
inside the clear recomp)

games with scm change which need to be reviewed (a lot of these are cache/may not need to be reviewed
if cache is depreciated to eliminate self mod dropdown):
