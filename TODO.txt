Finish #217# #218# and #129# translations for Brazilian Portugese, French, and Spanish.
217 is now 134
218 is now 150
need translation for 214 "Jumper Pak"

Review ifndef MIN_SIZE stuff as well as potential missing memory registers in r4300i_SW_NonMemory for ifndef MIN_SIZE

more hack support
lookout for Paper Mario Code Name Abyss ROMhack
Check Mark Kurko, often uploads ROMhacks
Look in the demo's for ongoing projects, when those are complete we can upload the full version

make "set memory" a ROM Setting if needed if TLOZ auto isn't enough (cannot be active with pmem if
self mod system is dropped since pmem doesn't execute code in the function block where setmem is done
inside the clear recomp)

games with scm change which need to be reviewed (a lot of these are cache/may not need to be reviewed
if cache is depreciated to eliminate self mod dropdown):

Some Games to Test:
The World Is Not Enough - Reserved by TrulyNaN
1080 Snowboarding
International Superstar Soccer 64
Namco
Pokémon Stadium (ALL VERSIONS)
Smash Bros.
South Park Rally
Star Fox 64
Star Wars - Rogue Squadron

127 Protect Memory entries to test (test to see if we need a rat attack
hack in COMPILE_R4300I_CACHE block to execute for it)
^ When we test them, see if we can get away with pmem off instead!
