----------------------------------1.6.1 CORE CHANGES----------------------------------
There were many new changes introduced by the former Project64 Team for Version 1.6.1.

However, a couple of changes they introduced lead to many games no longer working like
Pok√©mon Stadium 1 no longer booting. Similarly, there was some code in the OG PJ64 1.6
which was redundant, e.g. it did not do anything or it wasn't well thought out and had
adverse side effects. So, any code with adverse side effects or didn't do anything are
removed, and further changes introduced in Project64 Version 1.6.1 have been commented
out. In the case that these changes can be reintroduced and benefit Project64 Ver1.6.2
without causing any adverse side effects, I have setup a system for you to do that. Do
Replace all with these parameters to reinstate the core/emulation changes from V1.6.1:


These:
/* Is this needed?
Is this needed? */
// Is this needed?

To this:
""

You will also need to go into Interpreter Ops.c at these functions:
void _fastcall r4300i_SLTI
void _fastcall r4300i_SLTIU

And then remove the code below the function but keep the //'d line and un// the line.


The emulator will use 1.6.1's core if you replace all those with blank (no characters)
but beware that I've seen some of this code in PJ64 Legacy which is infamous for being
poorly tested. So I think it's the best strat that this code be kept out of the source
unless it's discovered it's actually needed for something and does not break anything.

P.S. But bear in mind even if you make these changes, it will not fully resemble 1.6.1
core because I have removed parts that had been added in 1.6.1 and stuff already there
from 1.6 which I either didn't care about/disliked/or if it was causing bad emulation.
